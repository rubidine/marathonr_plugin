Marathonr
=========

Integrates your rails project with the MarathonR background runner gem.


Example
=======

WorkRequest.create!(:worker => 'background_worker1', :key => 'U-niQueKey')

In lib you'll find some files.  One can be included in ApplicationController to
get some handy shortcuts.  One can be subclassed for your workers.  Check thre
rake tasks, too -- you'll need to migrate from it.
